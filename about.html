    Peponi School is a boarding school that is designed around the British Public School tradition.<br>The independent schools in the United Kingdom have a long and established history of preparing their pupils for the challenges of university and life beyond a formal education.  Peponi School is a young and newly formed school but one that has taken no time to take its place amongst some of the best schools in the world.

  Peponi School was established in 1989, to be a first class, independent, co-educational boarding school with an international intake of pupils working towards internationally recognised examinations at 16+ (IGCSEs) and 18+ (A Levels).<br>

  I have always strongly believed that having the opportunity to educate other people's children is a rare privilege that brings with it a responsibility to provide the best all round education that prepares our pupils for the challenges of an ever-changing world. Peponi School sets very exacting standards and the expectations of our pupils is purposefully high.<br>

  Our pupils are educated to believe in themselves, to be inquisitive, to be resilient and to be ambitious.  We praise high-achievers in any aspect of their life, whether it is in the classroom, on the sports field or on the stage.<br>Peponi School is purposefully small as we value community. We are a genuine multi-faith and multi-racial school where pupils respect each other and value the differences that contribute to our unique society.

  I hope you will take the time to visit the School, so that you can see at first hand why we have a reputation as one of the most beautiful and well equipped schools in East Africa.<br>  I am confident that you will sense our commitment to provide a rigorous approach to learning and a sensitive and caring provision of pastoral care. We want to encourage our young men and women to grow in depth and think beyond themselves and begin their development to become hard working and honourable members of our society.</div>
